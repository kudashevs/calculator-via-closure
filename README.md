# Calculator via Closures

This is a case study that aims to show one of the possible ways of using closures in PHP language.
 

The main idea is that we use Calculator function which receives closure implementation of some mathematical operation as
an argument and store it inside. When we can calculate the result through this stored Closure referring it like
"variable function" with arguments or invoking it another way.


This isn't a production solution, but only a training exercise which helps better understand how Closures work.  
Any ideas, suggestions, and reviews will be much appreciated :)
